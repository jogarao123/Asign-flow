Full Stack Application Assignment Submission

This repository contains the code and resources for the assignment submission of a full stack application developed using React.js, TypeScript, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. The application aims to provide a comprehensive example of a full stack web application with a frontend built using React.js and TypeScript, a backend implemented with Java and Spring Boot, and a MySQL database for data persistence.
Features

The full stack application includes the following features:

    User authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
    CRUD operations: Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on various entities in the application.
    RESTful API: The backend exposes RESTful APIs to handle client requests and interact with the MySQL database.
    Database integration: The application utilizes MySQL as the database for data storage and retrieval.
    Frontend UI: The frontend is built using React.js and TypeScript, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to develop this full stack application:

    Frontend:
        React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
        TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
        HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the user interface.

    Backend:
        Java: A general-purpose programming language.
        Spring Boot: A framework for building Java applications with ease.
        MySQL: An open-source relational database management system.

Getting Started
